## [berkeley CS61A project](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa15/proj/)

## There are four projects in CS61a:

### 1. hog

This is a small game for two player with a simple GUI. Players are supposed to to work out a good strategy so that they can accumulate enough in shorter turns than their competitor does.

### 2. 

### 3.

### 4. scheme

/scheme : completed project of old version

/scheme1 : uncompleted project of newversion

so there are still some works to do:

* check up these two folds and find out something useful in the new version so as to improve the old one.

* find more tips in [project introduction](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa15/proj/scheme/)
